          The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, colloquially &quot;the Met&quot;,[a] is
          the largest art museum in the Americas. In 2022 it welcomed 3,208,832 visitors, ranking it
          the third most visited U.S museum, and eighth on the list of most-visited art museums in
          the world.[6] Its permanent collection contains over two million works,[1] divided among
          17 curatorial departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the Museum Mile
          on the eastern edge of Central Park on Manhattan&apos;s Upper East Side, is by area one of
          the world&apos;s largest art museums. The first portion of the approximately
          2-million-square-foot (190,000 m2) building was built in 1880. A much smaller second
          location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive
          collection of art, architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe.

          The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 with its mission to bring art and art
          education to the American people. The museum&apos;s permanent collection consists of works
          of art from classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures from nearly
          all the European Old Masters, and an extensive collection of American and modern art. The
          Met maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art.
          The museum is home to encyclopedic collections of musical instruments, costumes, and
          accessories, as well as antique weapons and armor from around the world. Several notable
          interiors, ranging from 1st-century Rome through modern American design, are installed in
          its galleries.{' '}
